## What I've done

In these configuration files you will find:
 - Neovim configuration using Packer for plugin manager (working on using a proper LSP configuration and better keymaps)
 - i3 with custom keybinds
 - Polybar configuration, even if is pretty standard (you can change the bar in the i3 config file and it will set a themed bar)
 - Thunar config files (they still need work right now)
 - Some bash aliases and ohmyposh configuration for a cool command line
 - Alacritty configuration
 - All my installed fonts
 - Glava config for audio visualizer on all workspaces
 - X11 configuration to start i3 window manager
 - my spotify theme using spicetify

 ## I'm currently working on

 - [ ] upgrading polybar style and design
 - [ ] fixing neovim configuration because it's still not perfect but usable
 - [ ] implementing more feature with i3
 - [ ] better audio configuration
 - [ ] customize Thunar file explorer
